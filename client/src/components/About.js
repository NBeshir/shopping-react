                  We are a private company located in Pleasanton, CA. Our
                  Company imports quality coffee from Ethiopia, a country
                  located in the Eastern part of Africa. We bring your coffee
                  directly from the farmers at a fair price. We ship freshly
                  produced and washed coffee through freight and distribute it
                  to local roasters and coffee shops.

                  Although we are a business and have to make profit, we also
                  have strongly held values. We believe that apart from making
                  money, we also have a purpose to serve people in our
                  community. We pay farmers a very fair price, make sure that
                  everyone involved in the washing and cleaning process is also
                  paid very fairly. Also after we brought the coffee to the USA,
                  we sell it at a very competitive price. We also give back to
                  our local charity organizations.
